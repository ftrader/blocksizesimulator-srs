\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Purpose}
This document describes all the requirements for a blocksize simulator
(hereafter shortened to `simulator').

These requirements do not yet map to an actual implementation release
as the simulator has not yet been developed.

This SRS describes the entire simulator system.


\section{Document Conventions}
To be completed (TBC)


\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended for software developers and users of the simulator.

Software developers are encouraged to develop their own implementations based
on these requirements.

Users may find the requirements useful to understand what the simulator is
intended to do.



\section{Project Scope}
The purpose of the simulator is to test a narrow class of adjustable
blocksize schemes for Bitcoin Cash, where consensus blocksize limits are
adjusted with only constants and actual blocksizes as inputs.

Using a simplified model of a Bitcoin Cash network comprised of resource-constrained
but upgradeable mining and service nodes, and including sources of `legitimate'
and `spam' transactions as well as `poison block' providers, the simulator is
intended to provide information on the following observables:

\begin{itemize}
\item response characteristics of various dynamic blocksize algorithms
\item induced transaction delays in face of full blocks (whether from legit or spam traffic)
\item mempool desynchronization
\item network splits
\item node downtime (both service and mining)
\item upgrade feasibility
\item cost needed for a malicious actor to incur damage to the network
\end{itemize}


\section{References}

\chapter{Overall Description}


\section{Product Perspective}
The simulator is intended to inform the selection of a dynamic blocksize algorithm
for Bitcoin Cash.

It is intended to be standalone, self-contained, easily adaptable and
re-usable in future.

Test scenarios and algorithms subjected to simulation may be maintained
outside of the simulator project.


\section{Product Functions}
Basic description of the main functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interpret command line arguments provided by user to start a simulation run
\item Read scenario inputs from user-provided text files
\item Optionally, generate a block history as initial condition for the simulation
\item Run the network simulation for n blocks, optionally outputting traces to console or log file
\item Stop and output simulation results (to console or disk)
\end{itemize}



\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The simulator is intended to be used by anyone with an interest in Bitcoin Cash
dynamic blocksize algorithms.

This includes protocol developers, miners, service providers and hobbyists.

Operation of the simulator will require only editing of text files and issuance of
commands in a shell (i.e. at least initially it will be an interpreted command line
program).

Interpretation of the simulator output will likely require domain expert knowledge.


\section{Operating Environment}
The simulator is intended to run on standard commodity personal computer hardware
equipped a suitable interpreter and any required libraries.


\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
TBC

\section{User Documentation}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
Initially, the simulator user interface will be text console driven with input
provided by command line and configuration text files, and output written to
console and/or disk.

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
None.

\section{Software Interfaces}
The software is stand-alone and uses OS facilities for console and file I/O.

No other software interfaces are planned.

\subsection{Scenario Files}
To be decided (TBD)

\subsection{Blocksize algorithms}
To be specified as an interface which has to be implemented for a node.
It will have access to the node's view of the blockchain in order to make
its calculations based on past block sizes.

The same algorithm will be used by all the nodes in a simulation run.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
None.


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class,
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the
most logical sense for your product.$>$


\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Description}

A scenario defines all the inputs for a simulation run.
It may be specified in one single file or a collection of files (TBD),
but in either case there shall be one single file that acts as the
main starting point to provide the input data used in a simulator run.

Some example scenario files can be provided with the base simulator.

Editing scenario files is outside the scope of this SRS. As they will be pure
text files, it can be left to the user and their favorite text editor.


\subsection{Priority}

High


\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

When users start the simulator, they will need to specify the (main)
scenario file on the command line.

The simulator processes the scenario file and any potential dependencies.

If there are no errors (such as missing or invalid data), the simulation
will run, otherwise the simulator should exit with appropriate error messages.


\subsection{Functional Requirements}

$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous,
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

\subsubsection{SCENARIO-REQ-1}

The simulator shall read in the scenario file provided on the command line and
automatically process any dependencies (further included scenario files).


\subsubsection{SCENARIO-REQ-2}

The simulator shall abort if any required input information is missing or
invalid after processing the scenario file(s).

\subsubsection{SCENARIO-REQ-3}
Any missing/invalid scenario information shall be listed to the user to enable
them to adequately configure the scenario.


\section{System Feature 2 (and so on)}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
None.

\section{Security Requirements}
None.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
It is important the simulator be easily configurable and adaptable.

Python is recommended as it is widely available across platforms and supported
by common development environments.

Most Bitcoin Cash developers would be able to do the Python programming needed
to implement further blocksize algorithms for testing, and even enhancements
to the simulator.

Python provides good libraries and unit testing facilities, and also modules
for a possible GUI that could be constructed to make handling the simulator
easier in future.


\section{Business Rules}
None.


\chapter{Other Requirements}
None / TBD.

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
