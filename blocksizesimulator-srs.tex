\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Purpose}
This document describes all the requirements for a blocksize simulator 
(hereafter shortened to `simulator').

These requirements do not yet map to an actual implementation release
as the simulator has not yet been developed.

This SRS describes the entire simulator system.


\section{Document Conventions}
To be completed (TBC)


\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended for software developers and users of the simulator.

Software developers are encouraged to develop their own implementations based
on these requirements.

Users may find the requirements useful to understand what the simulator is
intended to do.



\section{Project Scope}
The purpose of the simulator is to test a narrow class of adjustable 
blocksize schemes for Bitcoin Cash, where consensus blocksize limits are 
adjusted with only constants and actual blocksizes as inputs.

Using a simplified model of a Bitcoin Cash network comprised of resource-constrained
but upgradeable mining and service nodes, and including sources of `legitimate'
and `spam' transactions as well as `poison block' providers, the simulator is 
intended to provide information on the following observables:

\begin{itemize}  
\item response characteristics of various dynamic blocksize algorithms
\item induced transaction delays in face of full blocks (whether from legit or spam traffic)
\item mempool desynchronization
\item network splits
\item node downtime (both service and mining)
\item upgrade feasibility
\item cost needed for a malicious actor to incur damage to the network
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Overall Description}


\section{Product Perspective}
The simulator is intended to inform the selection of a dynamic blocksize algorithm
for Bitcoin Cash.

It is intended to be standalone, self-contained, easily adaptable and
re-usable in future.

Test scenarios and algorithms subjected to simulation may be maintained
outside of the simulator project.


\section{Product Functions}
Basic description of the main functions:
\begin{itemize}  
\item Interpret command line arguments provided by user to start a simulation run
\item Read scenario inputs from user-provided text files
\item Optionally, generate a block history as initial condition for the simulation 
\item Run the network simulation for n blocks, optionally outputting traces to console or log file
\item Stop and output simulation results (to console or disk)
\end{itemize}



\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The simulator is intended to be used by anyone with an interest in Bitcoin Cash
dynamic blocksize algorithms.

This includes protocol developers, miners, service providers and hobbyists.

Operation of the simulator will require only editing of text files and issuance of
commands in a shell (i.e. at least initially it will be an interpreted command line
program).

Interpretation of the simulator output will likely require domain expert knowledge.


\section{Operating Environment}
The simulator is intended to run on standard commodity personal computer hardware
equipped a Python v3 interpreter and any required Python libraries.

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
Initially, the simulator user interface will be text console driven with input
provided by command line and configuration text files, and output written to
console and/or disk.
 
\section{Hardware Interfaces}
None.

\section{Software Interfaces}
The software is stand-alone and uses OS facilities for console and file I/O.

No other software interfaces are planned.

\subsection{Scenario Files}
To be decided (TBD)

\subsection{Blocksize algorithms}
To be specified as a Python interface which has to be implemented for a node.
It will have access to the node's view of the blockchain in order to make
its calculations based on past block sizes.

The same algorithm will be used by all the nodes in a simulation run.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
None.


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

\section{System Feature 2 (and so on)}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
