(Work in progress - see comments below)

This is a Software Requirement Specification for a simulator to
assess dynamic blocksize algorithms on Bitcoin Cash.

This specification is still in draft and expected to undergo further
changes. Feedback is welcomed - you can raise issues or submit pull
requests on this repository.

A Python implementation development is kicked off about the time this
repository was made public (23 May 2019), and will be opened once it
is usable in alpha state.

A public slack for those who wish to discuss this specification or its
implementation(s) may be announced shortly.

## Building

To build PDF from .tex on Debian:

Make sure you have `texlive-xetex` installed, run `make`.

If you're working on it and want to tidy up the TeX,
you need the `latexindent.pl` tool installed and run `make indent`.
